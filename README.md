# Machine Learning Project---Churn-Prediction
We have created a prediction model where our model predicts the amount of Churn in Telecom Industry.
# Machine Algorithms used:-
1.**Decision Tree Classifier**:- They are versatile and easy to interpret. They can handle both numerical and categorical data, making them suitable for churn prediction.We got an accuracy of 80.5% by using this algorithm.
2. **Logistic Regression**:- This technique models the probability of churn based on independent variables. 
It provides insights into the impact of each predictor on churn probability.Logistic Regression gave us an accuracy of about 74%.
3. **Random Forest Classifier**:- It Combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy. 
It handles high-dimensional feature spaces and provides feature importance rankings.This gave us the most accurate results i.e. about 94% after resampling the data.

Evaluation and Performance Metrics used in our project:
# Confusion Matrix:
A confusion matrix shows the performance of a churn prediction model by comparing predicted and actual churn status.
# Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1-Score:
These metrics assess the model's overall performance, precision in identifying churners, recall in capturing all churners, and their harmonic mean.
